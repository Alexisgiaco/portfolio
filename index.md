## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Profile-picture-Alexis.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a mechanical engineering student at the University of Edinburgh, currently completing a year abroad at Cornell University. As a French citizen who grew up in London and studied across three countries, I pride myself on being curious, adaptable, and determined, always seeking to improve.

I’ve been involved in competitive sports throughout my life, and I bring that same discipline and drive to my engineering studies. Passionate about both automotive and aerospace engineering, I’m excited to be starting a three-month summer internship at McLaren Racing.
