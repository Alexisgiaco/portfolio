## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Profile-picture-Alexis.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Edinburgh currently on a year abroad at Cornell University. As a french citizen, having grown up in London, and studied in 3 different countries, I pride myself on being a curious, adaptable and determined student constantly looking to better myself. I have competed in sports my whole life and look to apply the dtermination I acquired in doing so to my studies. Passionate about automotive and aerospace engineering, I am about to start a 3 month summer internship at McLaren racing.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/assets/CV.pdf/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
