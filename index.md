## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Profile-picture-Alexis.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a mechanical engineering student at the University of Edinburgh, currently spending a year abroad at Cornell University. As a French citizen who grew up in London and studied across three countries, I consider myself curious, adaptable, and driven—always looking to learn and improve.

I also have a strong interest in finance and economics, which I’ve explored through two internships in the investment banking industry.

Take a look at my CV and a selection of projects I’ve completed through my academic and professional experiences below (with more to come). <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ '/assets/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a>
