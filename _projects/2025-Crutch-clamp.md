For a class project, we were asked to identify an everyday issue and design a product to solve it. After interviewing several people, my team and I found that many individuals who use crutches struggle to keep them from falling when seated at a table.

Our solution was to design a simple, reliable clamp that holds crutches upright when leaned against a table. The mechanism consists of a fixed lower block and a sliding upper clamp guided by a hollow channel. This upper part is lifted manually and then released, allowing two lateral compression springs to pull it down and generate a clamping force.

Using springs allowed our design to accommodate a range of table thicknesses—from 0.5” to 2.5”. The clamp secures to the table, and a strap wraps around the crutches to keep them in place and prevent slipping.

After testing the first version, we identified two key issues: the strap was hard to tighten, and the clamp snapped shut too quickly when removed from the table, posing a safety risk.

We addressed both by replacing the fabric strap with a custom 3D-printed gate system. This made the clamp easier to use, safer, and more secure. We also swapped the springs for ones with a lower stiffness, which improved usability for people with reduced grip strength while still keeping the clamp stable.

All structural parts were 3D printed, including the clamp blocks, spring housings, and the gate. This gave us design flexibility and fast prototyping. The only components we purchased were the compression springs from McMaster-Carr to ensure performance reliability.

In hindsight, we would have benefited from starting with cheaper materials like acrylic for the early prototypes. Our full commitment to 3D printing limited our ability to make larger improvements later on, due to cost constraints. As a result, most changes were made to smaller components rather than the main structure.
