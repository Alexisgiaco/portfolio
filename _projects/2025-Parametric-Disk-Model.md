During my summer internship at McLaren Racing, I was tasked with designing and optimising a brake disc. I used Star-CCM+ for both the CAD modelling and the CFD simulations to improve its performance.


A brake disc is a circular metal component attached to a car’s wheel. It works together with the caliper and brake pads to slow down or stop the vehicle. When the brake pedal is pressed, the caliper squeezes the pads against the disc, creating friction that slows the wheel's rotation.

In Formula One, the extremely high speeds generate significant heat in the wheels and brake disc. To address this, my team and I aimed to design a brake disc that could be cooled as efficiently as possible by optimising the shape and hole pattern to allow airflow without compromising structural integrity.

Our approach was to create a parametric disc model, allowing us to adjust key design parameters—such as the number of holes, number of rows, hole diameter, row offset angle, and spacing between holes—to evaluate their impact on cooling performance.

We found that a linear hole pattern caused stress to accumulate in specific areas, increasing the risk of cracking. To prevent this, we introduced an angular offset between rows, which helped distribute the stresses more evenly across the disc.
